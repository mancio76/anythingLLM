# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the existing CLI-based AnythingLLM Utilities Toolkit into a modern, cloud-native REST API service using FastAPI and Uvicorn. The new API service will provide a complete set of REST endpoints for document processing, workspace management, and automated question-answer testing against AnythingLLM instances, specifically designed for procurement and contract document analysis.

The refactored service will be serverless-ready, cloud-native, and completely independent from the existing CLI implementation with no backward compatibility requirements. The service will handle ZIP files containing PDF, JSON, or CSV documents and provide comprehensive logging throughout all operations. Storage for deflating Zip files can be a local volume or S3 bucket in AWS: configuration is needed. Redis Cache/Queue is optional and must be configurable. Database engine is PostgreSQL.

## Requirements

4. WHEN the service is deployed THEN it SHALL be cloud-native and serverless-ready
5. WHEN multiple requests are processed THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent operations safely
6. WHEN the service starts THEN it SHALL validate all configuration parameters and fail fast if invalid

### Requirement 2: Document Upload and Processing

**User Story:** As a procurement analyst, I want to upload ZIP files containing procurement documents (PDF, JSON, CSV) via REST API, so that I can process multiple document sets efficiently without using command-line tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Document Upload and Processing

1. WHEN a ZIP file is uploaded via POST request THEN the system SHALL extract and validate all contained files
2. WHEN files are extracted THEN the system SHALL only accept PDF, JSON, and CSV file formats

4. WHEN upload completes THEN the system SHALL return a unique job ID and processing status
5. WHEN invalid file types are found THEN the system SHALL reject the upload with appropriate error messages
6. WHEN file size exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 413 with size limit information
7. WHEN the ZIP extraction fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with detailed error information

### Requirement 3: Workspace Management

**User Story:** As a document manager, I want to create and manage AnythingLLM workspaces through REST endpoints, so that I can organize different procurement projects separately.

5. WHEN workspace listing is requested THEN the system SHALL return all available workspaces with their metadata
6. WHEN workspace deletion is requested THEN the system SHALL safely remove workspace and associated documents
7. WHEN workspace configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL apply changes and validate settings

### Requirement 4: Automated Question-Answer Testing

**User Story:** As a procurement analyst, I want to execute automated question sets against document workspaces via API, so that I can systematically extract key information from procurement documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Automated Question-Answer Testing

1. WHEN question sets are submitted THEN the system SHALL execute them against specified workspaces
2. WHEN questions are processed THEN the system SHALL support multiple LLM models (OpenAI, Ollama, Anthropic)
3. WHEN testing completes THEN the system SHALL return structured results with confidence scores
4. WHEN questions target specific document types THEN the system SHALL route queries appropriately
5. WHEN concurrent question processing occurs THEN the system SHALL manage thread creation and cleanup
6. WHEN question results are generated THEN the system SHALL provide export options (JSON, CSV)
7. WHEN question processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error diagnostics

### Requirement 5: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure AnythingLLM connections and processing parameters through environment variables and configuration files, so that I can deploy the service across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Configuration Management

1. WHEN the service starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from environment variables and config files
2. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL fail startup with clear error messages
3. WHEN AnythingLLM connection parameters change THEN the system SHALL support runtime configuration updates
4. WHEN different LLM models are configured THEN the system SHALL validate model availability
5. WHEN logging configuration is specified THEN the system SHALL apply structured logging settings
6. WHEN security settings are configured THEN the system SHALL enforce authentication and authorization
7. WHEN configuration endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL return sanitized configuration data

### Requirement 6: Job Management and Status Tracking

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to track the status of long-running document processing and question-answer jobs, so that I can monitor progress and retrieve results when ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Job Management and Status Tracking

1. WHEN long-running operations start THEN the system SHALL create trackable job records
2. WHEN job status is requested THEN the system SHALL return current progress and estimated completion
3. WHEN jobs complete THEN the system SHALL persist results for retrieval
4. WHEN jobs fail THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information and logs
5. WHEN job cleanup is needed THEN the system SHALL provide job deletion and archival capabilities
6. WHEN multiple jobs run THEN the system SHALL manage job queuing and resource allocation
7. WHEN job history is requested THEN the system SHALL provide paginated job listings with filters

### Requirement 7: Health Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive health checks and monitoring endpoints, so that I can ensure service reliability in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Health Monitoring and Observability

1. WHEN health check endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL verify all critical dependencies
2. WHEN metrics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide performance and usage statistics
3. WHEN service monitoring occurs THEN the system SHALL expose Prometheus-compatible metrics
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log structured error information with correlation IDs

7. WHEN service scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL provide resource utilization metrics

### Requirement 8: Security and Authentication

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the API service to implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, so that only authorized users can access document processing capabilities.
