# Documentation Directory

This directory contains all documentation files for the AnythingLLM API project.

## Important Note for Future Development:

**Always place documentation files (*.md) in the `/api/docs/` directory, except for the main README.md which stays in the root `/api/` directory.**

This keeps the project root clean and organizes all documentation in one place.

## Current Structure:

- README.md (main project documentation - stays in /api/)
- docs/README.md (documentation index)
- docs/INSTALL.md (installation guide)
- docs/DEVELOPMENT.md (development guide)
- docs/TESTING.md (testing guide)
- docs/DEPLOYMENT.md (deployment guide)
- docs/API.md (API documentation)

## Future Documentation:

When adding new documentation, place it in this directory and update:

1. docs/README.md (add to the index)
2. README.md (add link if it's a major document)
3. validate_structure.py (add to required_files if critical)

## Testing Documentation:

- docs/TESTING.md contains comprehensive testing guide
- All test files should be placed in /api/tests/ directory
